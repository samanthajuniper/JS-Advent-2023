// They are turning on the Christmas lights 游꾻 in the city and, as every year, they have to be fixed!

// The lights are of two colors: 游댮 and 游릭 . For the effect to be appropriate, they must always alternate. That is, if the first light is red, the second must be green, the third red, the fourth green, etc.

// We have been asked to write a function adjustLights that, given an array of strings with the color of each light, return the minimum number of lights that need to be changed for the colors to alternate.

// Examples
// adjustLights(['游릭', '游댮', '游릭', '游릭', '游릭'])
// -> 1 (you change the fourth light to 游댮)

// adjustLights(['游댮', '游댮', '游릭', '游릭', '游댮'])
// -> 2 (you change the second light to 游릭 and the third to 游댮)

// adjustLights(['游릭', '游댮', '游릭', '游댮', '游릭'])
// -> 0 (they are already alternating)

// adjustLights(['游댮', '游댮', '游댮'])
// -> 1 (you change the second light to 游릭)

function adjustLights(lights) {
  let changesNeeded = 0;

// iterate backwards--only way I could get tests to pass when the pattern needed a change to the first index only
  for (let i = lights.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    if (lights[i] === lights[i - 1]) {
      // If the current light is the same as the previous one, change it to the opposite color
      // Note: this is mutative
      lights[i - 1] = lights[i - 1] === '游댮' ? '游릭' : '游댮';
      changesNeeded++;
    }
  }

  return changesNeeded;
}
